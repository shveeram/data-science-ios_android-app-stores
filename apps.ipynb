    "2. If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.\n",

    "   3. Weather genre shows promise in that it ticks the rule that its practical use app rather than fun app which is near saturation point in AppStore - However, considering our primary goal of free app and maximising ad-revenue, weather might not be suitable genre were users would stay long enough within our app.\n",
    "   4. Other genres that provide practical purpose such as \"Food & Drink\" could be considered but these require deeper partnerships at the supply chain level but may be perhaps marketplace is preferrable option here.\n",

    "\n",

    "**Note of caution**: We do need to check about the rights and partnership for the book but more importantly it should not already been an eBook/Audio book through Amazon's platform.\n",

    "   4. There are higher proportion of apps in this category which provide sub-category of banking/payment services but also there is space for sub-category of \"Personal Finance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this genre requires deeper domain expertise, but if we could partner with some wealth management company or Financial adviser then we have a potential to add significant value to the user at the same time maximising the ad-revenue related to the financial advise in our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "> From all of the genres in the AppStore, two genres definetly emerge as potentials in the AppStore:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">> 1. \"Book\" genre perhaps with a popular/best selling published book not yet in Amazon platform\n",
    ">> 2. \"Finance\" genre in the Personal Finance section and maximise ad-revenue\n",

    "Consider our primary goal that we are going to launch the app in both AppStore and PlayStore albeit different timeline. \n",

    "So from that perspective, we are looking at the Top 5 apps on user base by the same genre/category in the AppStore we listed as potentials (Books and Finance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here again the \"Books\" category shows dominance by big player with their marketplace apps such as Google or Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it especially hard to launch a famous/best selling book as app without having license/rights issue with these big players is going to be hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommendation at this stage is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Develop a \"Personal Finance\" app in both AppStore and PlayStore**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "* We should not consider any sub-categories which require banking license, deep domain expertise and infrastructure (such as Payments) at this stage\n",
    "* To maximise the value we create for our user base and in turn maximise our ad-revenue, we should look at a partnership with a Financial advisor."
