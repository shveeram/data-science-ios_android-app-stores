    "\n",
    "1. Consistently in <mark>Navigation</mark>, <mark>Social Networking</mark>, <mark>Music</mark> generes few apps dominate the user base and hence they skew the results overall\n",
    "2. <mark>Reference</mark> genre is interesting. Bible and Dictionary has near monopoly same as Navigation with Google (Waze and Google Maps owned by Google)\n",
    "3. <mark>Weather</mark> genre shows promise and is a practical use app rather than fun app which is near saturation point in AppStore - However, considering our primary goal of free app and maximising ad-revenue, weather might not be suitable genre were users would not stay long enough within the app\n",
    "4. Other genres that provide practical purpose such as \"Food & Drink\" could be considered but these require deeper partnerships at the supply chain level but may be perhaps marketplace is preferrable option here\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though <mark>Book</mark> genre is dominated by Amazon, we see promise that small business apps such as \"Color Therapy Adult Coloring Book for Adults\", \"HOOKED - Chat Stories\" and \"OverDrive – Library eBooks and Audiobooks\" have good percentage of user base too (Combined ~35%).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we bring a standalone app in the <mark>Book</mark> genre perhaps of some famous best seller book there is potential for maximising ad-revenue by keeping the user within our app for longer time or creativity app such as kids or adult colouring book.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We do need to check about the rights and partnership for published books, but more importantly it should not already been an eBook/Audio book through Amazon's platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Finance</mark> genre is interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proportion of apps is only 1.12% of the AppStore\n",
    "- Average number of users on the apps is quite high\n",
    "- Top 5 apps in this space shows no monopoly by any big players and spread is even\n",
    "- There are higher proportion of apps that provide banking/payment services but also there is services for personal finance\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this genre requires deeper domain expertise, but if we could partner with some wealth management company or Financial adviser then we have a potential to add significant value to the user at the same time maximising the ad-revenue related to the financial advise in our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "From all of the genres in the AppStore, two genres definetly emerge as potentials in the AppStore:\n",
    "1. <mark>Book</mark> genre - Popular/best selling book not yet in big platforms (such as Amazon, Google, Apple) or Creativity app such as kids or adult colouring book\n",
    "2. <mark>Finance</mark> genre - Personal Finance app and maximise ad-revenue\n",

    "Note:\n",
    "- We should not consider any sub-categories which require banking license, deep domain expertise and infrastructure (such as Payments) at this stage\n",
    "- To maximise the value we create for our user base and in turn maximise our ad-revenue, we should look at a partnership with a Financial advisor."
